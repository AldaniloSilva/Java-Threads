# Java-Threads

Atividade Desafio Threads - Engenharia da Computação 6º semestre - Linguagem Programação II<br>
Activity carried out for Programming Language II discipline. <br>

Have you ever wondered how streaming data collection software works from the inside? <br>

The objective was to put into practice the basic concept of Thread in Java. The proposed challenge was to implement the idea behind messaging software, used for example in large data collection (Apache Kafka and AWS Kinesis are good examples of this softwares).

I created two threads, the first simulates sending messages, that is, it plays the role of the producer, the second plays the role of the consumer.

The messages from the Producer's Thread messages are presented in a TextArea on the forms. And consumer messages can be read by the terminal.
